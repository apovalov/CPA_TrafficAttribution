# Traffic_attribution


Modern analytics systems allow you to trace the entire path of a customer from the first transition to purchase: from which advertising channels he came, how many times and when, how much each user transition cost.

For example, an analytics system can trace that before buying new headphones, the customer went to the site from an advertising post in a social network. Then two more times went from contextual advertising. And finally, he made the purchase.

Question: Which of the advertising channels brought a new customer to the marketplace: social network or contextual advertising? Which one should you invest in next?

Traffic attribution is a set of rules that are used to assign a value to channels for attracting traffic. You can assign value to channels in many different ways. You can attribute the entire result of attracting a new customer to contextual advertising, because it was the last touch before the purchase. You can attribute the entire result to social media because it was the first touch. You can distribute the effect between the two channels according to a certain logic.


Basic traffic attribution models
Let's look at a few popular methods of how you can perform customer engagement attribution on advertising channels (customer touchpoints).

1. Last Touch: In this method, the full weight of attribution is given to the last contact before conversion. It's a simple method, but it can underestimate the value of previous contacts.
2. First Touch / First Touch: All the credit is given to the first contact in the buyer's journey. This method may underestimate the value of subsequent steps. 
3. Linear: All touches in the buyer's journey are given equal weight.
4. Time Decay: Touches that are closer to conversion are given more weight.
5. Position Based (U-Shaped) / Position Based (U-Shaped): 40% of the weight is given to the first and last touches and the remaining 20% is evenly distributed between intermediate touches.
